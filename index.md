I am a graduate student in the [Heavy Ion Nuclear Physics](http://starcluster.phy.uic.edu//twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) Group at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Our group studies the properties of matter in the hottest and densest conditions attainable in a lab. Our experiment is the [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern/tags/heavy-ions)  (CMS) which detects particles produced from high-energy proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (PbPb) nuclei collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located near Geneva, Switzerland. When two ultra-relativistic nuclei collide, they deposit a fraction of their energies into the space between them, which results in heating up the vacuum to temperatures around one million times hotter than the center of the sun. That super-hot vacuum is believed to create what is called a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a system of deconfined, strongly interacting, quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons in thermal equilibrium.  Together with many physicists from all over the world we study matter under extreme temperatures and densities in order to better understand how our Universe might have looked like right after its creation.

I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (Integrated M.Sc. 2015). In the past I've worked at the Department of High Energy Physics at TIFR, Mumbai and at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in KIT, Germany.
